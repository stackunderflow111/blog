I am currently working at Hulu and building our experience management system. Go to [hulu.com](https://www.hulu.com) and login (welcome to subscribe if you haven't!), you will find what is controlled by our team: what to display for each row, how to display the rows on each page, and how we layout things differently on different devices (hulu.com website, mobile, TV, and Play Station, etc.).

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University and Master's degree , also in Computer Science, from UC San Diego.

During my college years, I interned at Kneron, building a neural network inferencing framework in C++ for an internal computer vision SDK, where I got familiar with C++ and CUDA programming. I also interned at Yiwise.ai and developed the management backend for an AI call center platform in Java and Spring, where I learned backend web development.
