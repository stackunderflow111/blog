## How computers work

The book [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/code-the-hidden/9780735634688/) is a great introduction of how computers work. It covers only the basic stuff so it doesn't require any special knowledge or skills to read, but even experienced programmers find its content valuable. *(Strongly Recommended)*

## Linux

The book [Harley Hahn's Guide to Unix and Linux](http://www.harley.com/books/sg3.html) is a great introduction to Linux for first time users. It explains the concepts very well and makes sure you understand them clearly. Some contents like GUI are outdated and could be skipped. *(Strongly Recommended)*

The book [How Linux Works](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/how-linux-works/9781098128913/) is best for people who want to become a power Linux user. It covers some deeper topics like disks, filesystems, networking, etc. I recommend this book if you have used Linux regularly for 1 or 2 years.

## Programming Languages

The Udemy course [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/) covers the most obscure concepts in Javascript, like execution contexts, this, closures and prototypes, and presents them in a straightforward way. The only problem I find is that the instructor speaks too slow so I always play it at 1.25x speed. *(Strongly Recommended)*

## Functional Programming

The educative course [Functional Programming Patterns With RamdaJS](https://www.educative.io/courses/functional-programming-patterns-with-ramdajs) introduces functional programming concepts and Ramda.js.

The book [Functional Programming in Scala](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-programming-in/9781617290657/) introduces functional programming with Scala. I am currently reading this book with a group of colleagues. It has a lot of exercises to make sure you understand the concepts well. One of the problems of this book is that it might use certain Scala features without explaining them in detail, so be prepared for some googling.

## Category Theory

The book (in the form of a series of blog posts) [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) explains category theory and its connection to programming. The author also has [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/DrBartosz/playlists) on the same topic. I do find the lectures more approachable than the book. I only finished the first part of the videos and the corresponding chapters of the book, and I think it's more  than sufficient for an average programmer like me:) *(Strongly Recommended)*

## Distributed Systems

The book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) is a must-read in this field, although it covers more than distributed systems. The author also has a [Distributed Systems lecture series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB) taught at University of Cambridge *(Strongly Recommended)*

The [CSE 128: Distributed Systems](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNPUF5QyWU8PydLG2cIJrCvnn5I_exhYx) course from UCSC covers mostly the theoretical part and it's friendly to beginners. *(Strongly Recommended)*

I only recommend [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html) for people who already have knowledges about distributed systems, it might be too hard for beginners.
